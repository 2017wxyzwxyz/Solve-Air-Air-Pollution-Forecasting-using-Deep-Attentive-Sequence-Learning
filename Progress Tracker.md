# Air-Pollution-Forecasting-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
First step towards solving a real-life problem - Air Pollution Forecasting in Delhi, using deep learning


Progress tracker:

Note: I will also add notes related to mu endeavor towards solving this problem.

After reading this wonderful paper, "Deep Air: Forecasting Air Pollution in Beijing, China" provided in the link https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/sproject_attachments/deep-air-forecasting_final.pdf related to this topic, I am currently learning this cool concept of Recurrent Neural Network (different versions like vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU, phased-GRU) to understand it in and out in depth to implement it on the go for the project's objective.

Spending time doing the course of Deep Learning, "Sequence Models" to gain this understanding in a practical sense by actually implementing the algorithm from scratch and using them for different problems provided in the assignments.

Spending time on understanding the different optimization routines like Adaptive Learning, Adam, RMSProp, Nestervo Momentum to realize which one is best to use for our particular objective loss function and problem data that we have.

Spending time on understanding the different pre-training and robustness maximisation technqiues like dropout neural network.

Spending time on gaining complete understanding of Keras and TensorFlow frameworks I would utilize for implementing the solution to our problem.
